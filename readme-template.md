## About

For a more detailed description, see the manuscript above.

This package provides a function (`find()`) that locates and statistically tests effects in time-series data. It does so by using crossvalidation to identify time points to test, and then using a linear mixed effects model to actually perform the statistical test. More specifically, the data is subdivided in a number of subsets (by default 4). It takes one of the subsets (the *test* set) out of the full dataset, and conducts a linear mixed effects model on each sample of the remaining data (the *training* set). The sample with the highest absolute z value in the training set is used as the sample-to-be-tested for the test set. This procedure is repeated for all subsets of the data, and for all fixed effects in the model. Finally, a single linear mixed effects model is conducted for each fixed effects on the samples that were thus identified.

This packages also provides a function (`plot()`) to visualize time-series data to visually annotate the results of `find()`.


## Dependencies

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [datamatrix](https://datamatrix.cogsci.nl/)
- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## Usage

We will use data from [Zhou, Lorist, and Mathôt (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.23.469689). In brief, this is data from a visual-working-memory experiment in which participant memorized one or more colors (set size: 1, 2, 3 or 4) of two different types (color type: proto, nonproto) while pupil size was being recorded during a 3s retention interval.

This dataset contains the following columns:

- `pupil`, which is is our dependent measure. It is a baseline-corrected pupil time series of 300 samples, recorded at 100 Hz
- `subject_nr`, which we will use as a random effect
- `set_size`, which we will use as a fixed effect
- `color_type`, which we will use as a fixed effect

First, load the dataset:

```python
from datamatrix import io
dm = io.readpickle('data/zhou_et_al_2021.pkl')
```

The `plot()` function provides a convenient way to plot pupil size over time as a function of one or two factors, in this case set size and color type:

```python
import time_series_test as tst
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

tst.plot(dm, dv='pupil', hue_factor='set_size', linestyle_factor='color_type')
plt.savefig('img/signal-plot-1.png')
```

From this plot, we can tell that there appear to be effects in the 1500 to 2000 ms interval. To test this, we could perform a linear mixed effects model on this interval, which corresponds to samples 150 to 200.

The model below uses mean pupil size during the 150 - 200 sample range as dependent measure, set size and color type as fixed effects, and a random by-subject intercept. In the more familiar notation of the R package `lme4`, this corresponds to `mean_pupil ~ set_size * color_type + (1 | subject_nr)`. (To use more complex random-effects structures, you can use the `re_formula` argument to `mixedlm()`.)

```python
from statsmodels.formula.api import mixedlm
from datamatrix import series as srs, NAN

dm.mean_pupil = srs.reduce(dm.pupil[:, 150:200])
dm_valid_data = dm.mean_pupil != NAN
model = mixedlm(formula='mean_pupil ~ set_size * color_type',
                data=dm_valid_data, groups='subject_nr').fit()
print(model.summary())
```

The model summary shows that, assuming an alpha level of .05, there are significant main effects of color type (z = -2.136, p = .033), set size (z = 17.2, p < .001), and a significant color-type by set-size interaction (z = 2.47, p = .014). However, we have selectively analyzed a sample range that we knew, based on a visual inspection of the data, to show these effects. This means that our analysis is circular: we have looked at the data to decide where to look! The `find()` function improves this by splitting the data into training and tests sets, as described under [About](#about), thus breaking the circularity.

```python
results = tst.find(dm,  'pupil ~ set_size * color_type',
                   groups='subject_nr', winlen=5)
```


The return value of `find()` is a `dict`, where keys are effect labels and values are named tuples of the following:

- `model`: a model as returned by `mixedlm().fit()`
- `samples`: a set with the sample indices that were used
- `p`: the p-value from the model
- `z`: the z-value from the model

```python
for effect, (model, samples, p, z) in results.items():
    print('{} was tested at samples {} → z = {:.4f}, p = {:.4}'.format(
          effect, samples, z, p))
```

We can pass the `results` to `plot()` to visualize the results:

```python
tst.plot(dm, dv='pupil', hue_factor='set_size', linestyle_factor='color_type',
         results=results)
plt.savefig('img/signal-plot-2.png')
```
